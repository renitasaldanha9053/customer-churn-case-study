This is the structure of my ML project:

customer-churn-case-study
  - data
    - processed (Contains more refined version)
      - cleaned_customer_churn.csv
      - engineered_customer_churn.csv
      - predicted_customer_churn.csv
      - metrics.json
    - raw (Contains the original dataset)
      - customer_churn.csv
  - src
    - 01_eda.ipynb
    - 02_model_prototype.ipynb
    - 03_model_evaluation.ipynb
    - custom_metrics.py
    - data_cleaning.py
    - feature_engineering.py
    - model_builder.py
    - tuner.py
    - visual_eval.py
     
So in the src file all my code snippets reside. I'll give you all the code snippets one by one ok?
Starting with data_cleaning.py and  feature_engineering.py?
